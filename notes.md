- JSX is syntactic sugar for creating React element
- we cannot change react element
- react elements are valid javascript expression
- react component returns react element
- one react component returns one single react
- we can reuse react component
- component receive properties from outside
- babel will transpile this to valid javascript
- react automatically calls render method of class component
- react component will re-render whenever props change
- state in class component is simply react object

- componentDidMount() runs after component has rendered to the DOM
- componentWillUnmount() runs just before unmounting the component from the DOM
- A higher order component is a function that takes a component as a parameter and returns a new component
- render props is a props that defines render logic
